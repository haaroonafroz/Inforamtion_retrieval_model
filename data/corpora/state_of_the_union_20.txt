In our first year, we cut the deficit by $350 billion. In our second year, we cut it by more than $900 billion. And we've continued to reduce the deficit while growing our economy and creating a record number of jobs. In fact, we've created over 500,000 manufacturing jobs since I took office.

As we gather here tonight, we're writing the next chapter in the great American story - a story of progress and resilience unlike any in the world. When world leaders ask me to define America - and they do, believe me - I define our country in one word: possibilities.

For decades, the middle class has been hollowed out. Too many jobs moved overseas. Factories closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be. The pandemic only made things worse. But now America is coming back.

Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military. Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court. Distinguished guests, my fellow Americans.

Tonight I want to talk about what we've done, what we have to do, and the extraordinary opportunity that lies before us. We meet tonight as Americans, and we have each been given a great gift - the freedom to determine our destiny and the obligation to fulfill our common purpose.
