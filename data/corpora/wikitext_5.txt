The history of computing hardware starting with the earliest mechanical calculating devices up to the modern day. Before the 20th century, most calculations were done by humans. Early mechanical tools to help humans with calculations included the abacus and the slide rule. The first electronic computers were developed in the mid-20th century.

The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks. Web resources are accessible through the Internet. The Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence of humans and other animals. AI research defines artificial intelligence as a machine that can learn from experience, adjust to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks. Modern AI techniques include machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.

Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of algorithms that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision.
